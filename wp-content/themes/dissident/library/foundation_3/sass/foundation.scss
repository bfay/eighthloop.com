Stylesheet: Main Stylesheet

Here's where the magic happens. Here, you'll see we are calling in
the separate media queries. The base mobile goes outside any query
and is called at the beginning, after that we call the rest
of the styles inside media queries.

//
// IMPORTING STYLES
//

// import css3 core, normalize, and the basic functions used throughout 
@import "compass/css3";
@import "foundation-style/normalize";
@import "foundation-style/functions";

//Should you choose to do advanced modular scaling, this is where to insert it
@import "foundation-style/modular-scale";

//basic variables
@import "foundation-style/settings";

//text dependencies before the mixins
@import "foundation-style/typography";

// import mixins 
@import "foundation-style/mixins";

//semantic-grid which uses media queries to load/hide elements
@import "foundation-style/semantic-grid";

/*
BASE (MOBILE) SIZE 
This is the average viewing window. So Desktops, Laptops, and 
in general anyone not viewing on a mobile device. Here's where
you can add resource intensive styles.
*/

//fancy stylings from Zurb:)
@import "foundation-style/offcanvas";

/*
LARGER MOBILE DEVICES
This is for devices like the Galaxy Note or something that's 
larger than an iPhone but smaller than a tablet. Let's call them
tweeners.
*/

	// styles in 481up.scss

/*
TABLET & SMALLER LAPTOPS
This is the average viewing window. So Desktops, Laptops, and 
in general anyone not viewing on a mobile device. Here's where
you can add resource intensive styles.
*/

	//finally!  Some fun with the grid!

/*
DESKTOP 
This is the average viewing window. So Desktops, Laptops, and

	// styles in 1030up.scss

/*
LARGE VIEWING SIZE 
This is for the larger monitors and possibly full screen viewers.
*/

	// styles in 1240up.scss
	@import "foundation-style/1240up";

} // end of media query

/*
RETINA (2x RESOLUTION DEVICES)
This applies to the retina iPhone (4s) and iPad (2,3) along with 
other displays with a 2x resolution. You can also create a media
query for retina AND a certain size if you want. Go Nuts.
*/

} // end of media query 

/*
PRINT STYLESHEET
Feel free to customize this. Remember to add things that won't make
sense to print at the bottom. Things like nav, ads, and forms should
be set to display none.
